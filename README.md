ANN_Project_Main.ipynb: The main Jupyter Notebook containing the entire project workflow including data analysis, model building, and evaluation.
Getting Started

# To get started with this project, follow these steps:
Importing DataSet: The project begins with the import of the necessary data set for DOC prediction. <br>
Exploratory Data Analysis: This step involves an initial exploration of the dataset to understand its characteristics and prepare it for further processing.<br>
Data Cleaning: Essential data cleaning steps are carried out to ensure the quality of the dataset for model training.<br>
Feature Engineering: This step involves transforming or generating new features to improve the performance of the machine learning model.
Building the Model<be>

# The core of this project is building an ANN model for predicting DOC. The process involves:
Selecting appropriate features and preparing the dataset for training.<br>
Defining and training the ANN model.<br>
Evaluating the model's performance and making necessary adjustments.
